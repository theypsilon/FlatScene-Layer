#FlatScene

**FlatScene** library is a high abstraction layer designed to create *2D interactive applications* in a rapid and easy way. This library uses **OpenGL** to render 2D graphics supporting *hardware acceleration*, and **SDL** to manipulate I/O events. 

The library is meant to be written in modern **C++**, using some of the new features from the recent standard **C++11**. It benefits as well from the *portability* inherited from **SDL** and **OpenGL**, thus allows to the user a way of handling *multiplattform projects* without so much concerns.

#Itemology

This will be a **test game** created to show the features of **FlatScene**. Unfortunately, it isn't playable already since its develop status is still quite green.

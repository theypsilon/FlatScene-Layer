#FlatScene

**FlatScene** is a high abstraction layer designed to create *2D interactive applications* in a rapid and easy way. This library uses **OpenGL** to render 2D graphics supporting *hardware acceleration*, and **SDL** to manipulate I/O events. 

Actually, the library is ready for use in **C++**. It benefits from the *portability* inherited from SDL and OpenGL, thus allowing to the user the managing of *multiplattform projects* without so much concerns.

#DemoArk

This is a TestApp created to show the functionability of FlatScene.

In this demo, the input keys are :

* **ESC** : Simple option *menu*. You got here an option for leaving the demo.

* **F1** : Swap between *tests*.
* **F2** : *Restart* current test.
* **F3** : Swap *fullscreen mode* - *window mode*.

* **SPACE** : *Pause*.

* **Arrow keys** : *Walking*.

* In first test, press **u** to stress *change map* test.

* In double cam test, press **a** to kill the grey enemies.
